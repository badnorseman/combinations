/**
 * K-combinations
 * 
 * Get k-sized combinations of elements in a set.
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   k_combinations(set, k)
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   set: Array of objects of any type. They are treated as unique.
 *   k: size of combinations to search for.
 * 
 * Return:
 *   Array of found combinations, size of a combination is k.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 1)
 *   -> [[1], [2], [3]]
 * 
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 2)
 *   -> [[1,2], [1,3], [2, 3]
 * 
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 3)
 *   -> [[1, 2, 3]]
 * 
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 4)
 *   -> []
 * 
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 0)
 *   -> []
 * 
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], -1)
 *   -> []
 * 
 *   k_combinations([], 0)
 *   -> []

  // Algorithm description:
  // To get k-combinations of a set, we want to join each element
  // with all (k-1)-combinations of the other elements. The set of
  // these k-sized sets would be the desired result. However, as we
  // represent sets with lists, we need to take duplicates into
  // account. To avoid producing duplicates and also unnecessary
  // computing, we use the following approach: each element i
  // divides the list into three: the preceding elements, the
  // current element i, and the subsequent elements. For the first
  // element, the list of preceding elements is empty. For element i,
  // we compute the (k-1)-computations of the subsequent elements,
  // join each with the element i, and store the joined to the set of
  // computed k-combinations. We do not need to take the preceding
  // elements into account, because they have already been the i:th
  // element so they are already computed and stored. When the length
  // of the subsequent list drops below (k-1), we cannot find any
  // (k-1)-combs, hence the upper limit for the iteration:
  for (let i = 0; i < set.length - k + 1; i++) {
    // head is a list that includes only our current element.
    const head = set.slice(i, i + 1);
    // We take smaller combinations from the subsequent elements
    const tailcombs = k_combinations(set.slice(i + 1), k - 1);
    // For each (k-1)-combination we join it with the current
    // and store it to the set of k-combinations.
    for (let j = 0; j < tailcombs.length; j++) {
      combs.push(head.concat(tailcombs[j]));
